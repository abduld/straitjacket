## RLIMITS
#################

## evidently not all versions of apparmor support setting this rlimit. it's okay
## because we kill -9 if user time overruns this.
#  set rlimit cpu <= 15,

  set rlimit fsize <= 0,
  set rlimit data <= 80M,
  set rlimit stack <= 80M,
  set rlimit core <= 0,
  set rlimit rss <= 5,
  set rlimit memlock <= 0,
  set rlimit msgqueue <= 0,
  set rlimit locks <= 0,
  set rlimit sigpending <= 2,
  set rlimit nproc <= 0,
  set rlimit rtprio <= 0,

# larger for DLLs
  set rlimit as <= 300M,

# 1 greater than max
  set rlimit nofile <= 101,

## so, nice values are confusing. 20 is low priority, -19 is high priority.
## here, we really want to enforce that the nice value is never less than 5,
## but the app armor configuration parser complains "expecting TOK_LE" if you
## use TOK_GE. so, maybe <= is just the wrong symbol to use for this config file
## to specify a limit? i absolutely don't want to enforce that the application
## is always 5 or lower niceness.
## TODO: revisit
#  set rlimit nice <= 5,
